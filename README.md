# Projeto Final - Processamento Avan√ßado de Sinais
This project aims to create a svm classifier trained with an EEG dataset for adhd. It was done in python, as a final assignment to the Advanced Signal Processing class.


If you want to download the dataset used in this project, you can do so at:

To have all the trained data, you can simply run the "train_svm.py" file. It will call back all the other steps, as long as you have downloaded the CSV file from the link above.

You can also run the "extract_csv.py" file, to only have the train and test raw datasets.

Another possibility is to run the "process_database.py" file, that outputs the .mat files with the calculated features for both train and test datasets.
